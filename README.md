Forked from: https://github.com/KrazyIvan777/CQ-MoreVehicles Which originally added extra vehicles to some Conquest maps. It was a polished mod, and I have made it unpolished.. haha.

I have a liking for helicopters, and I wanted to add helis to Battlefield 3 maps and modes that did not originally have them. I opted to use Flash_Hit's Bundleloader Some fun maps that have helicopters now are: Tehran Highway, Grand Bazaar, Metro, Ziba Tower, etc.

Since I am not a programmer, but can code some and tinker here and there, I'm aware there are major bugs in this. For example, using this mod... after a round is over, the game will crash and not go to the next map. It's not so bad, because you can set your tickets pretty high & still get enjoyment out of the game for a long while before a round ends.
