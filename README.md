<h2> <B> ========== Quick About ========== </b> </h2>

Forked from: [https://github.com/KrazyIvan777/CQ-MoreVehicles ](https://github.com/KrazyIvan777/CQ-MoreVehicles)

Which originally added extra vehicles to some Conquest maps. 

It was a polished mod, and I have made it unpolished.. haha.

<h2> <B>========== What's different? ========== </b> </h2>

I have a liking for helicopters, and I wanted to add helis to Battlefield 3 maps and modes that did not originally have them. 

With KrazyIvan's mod, the helicopters were not implemented on maps that did not originally have them. 

When I did add the helicopters, I somehow couldn't get the helicopter UI/HUD to display (among other things).

Fortunately, I found [Flash_Hit's Bundleloader](https://github.com/FlashHit/BundleLoader) , but that also meant I had to integrate the code to work with it, not knowing specifically if that would solve the UI/HUD issue. (It did! Thanks Bree_Arnold!).

Then there was a flying wobble issue that DesertShadow & Jassent helped me to solve.

Seeing as I'm not a programmer, just someone who can kind of tinker here and there, it took me a lot of trial and error.

Some fun maps that have helicopters now are: Tehran Highway, Grand Bazaar, Metro, Ziba Tower, etc. Even Canals TDM has helicopters :) 

<h2> <B>========== Some warnings ========== </b> </h2>

Since I am not a programmer, I'm aware there are some bugs in this. 

For example, using this mod... after a round is over, the game will crash and not go to the next map. *shrugs* 

It's not so bad, because you can set your tickets pretty high & still get great enjoyment out of the game for a long while before a round ends. 

I'm sure someone who actually knows how to code could fix this.
